    <p>Today I updated the site's design to be more in line with what I would consider "cool" or even "badass." Such example: </p>
    <p align="center"><img src="/gifs/terminator-hand1.gif"></p>
    <p>Yes, I know, almost too cool... <em>Almost.</em> That's right, I'm using italics now. Even bolds and underlines when I deem it so. I've switched to Times New Roman, and so the faux typewriter nonsense is gone! We're on a computer, now act like it! I like the logo in the top left, though, so that's staying for now. In case I update it, here is what it looks like now: </p>

    <p>So sweet. If anyone is wondering how I chose the name for this website, well, I can't tell you. It's no secret, it's just that I've forgotten. I started using thefearisback as a username on different platforms somewhat recently, and I don't know why. My best guess is <a href="https://youtu.be/q6WD-2QeOXk?t=82">this</a>. I'll try to post one entry a day for as long as I can, even if there isn't much to say. If I miss a day or something, don't get too upset. I also just noticed that the day this website was founded was exactly 247 years after many would say our great nation was founded. Truly wonderful. Hopefully I can do a better job running this website than the US Government does running their equivalent! Ha ha! I should write for a magazine!</p>
