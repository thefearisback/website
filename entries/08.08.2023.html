    <p>I graduated high school finally. Yay. It was at home, so no ceremonies or anything. I was sent a gif of spongebob cheering though. I suppose I'd rather have graduated normally, gone to prom or whatever, all of that. It's not necessary though, and if I did those things it would only serve to make me more normal. More and more I realise most people do not do things that I do. I don't think it's a bad thing. I hope not, at least.</p>
    <p>I've been playing Baldur's Gate recently. It's pretty fun. It's like DND except the game is the DM. I see now why people have fun playing it. I imagine it's more fun with real people, but then again, the game does all of the math for me. I've got a wizard character, or maybe he's a sorcerer, I don't know. He shoots fire from his hands. I've been trying to find a nice big pointy wizard hat, but apparently there are none in the game. It's actually surprising how quickly I lost interest after I found that out, and I haven't played since.</p>
