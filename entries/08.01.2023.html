    <p>Hello. I just reread my previous entry and, wow. What vitriol! I even swore a few times. Just know that I was a different person then, and I have grown and changed since. I saw Barbie and Oppenhiemer, and I liked them both. Real surprise there, he liked two good movies, wow. I don't really want to talk about it, because, if you're here for movie reviews, I'm sorry to say, I don't think I'm self absorbed enough for that. Hopefully not at least. It seems, as usual, the studios are learning the wrong lession from the success of Barbie and Oppenheimer. They are now planning on having other barbenheimer-esque smackdowns. One I see on the horizon is "saw patrol", being the upcoming Paw Patrol and Saw movies. The thing with saw patrol, is there is no audience overlap at all. All of the kids going to Paw Patrol are way too young for Saw, and all of the people seeing Saw would rather partake in said movie than sit through Paw Patrol. I'm not dissing Paw Patrol here, if anything, I'm dissing Saw fans! Take that!</p>
