    <p>I've decided that once the day has passed I'm not going to update these entries. It seems a little disingenuous. If I say something that ages horribly I'll just have to live with it. I've also found a wonderful website with a large archive of GIFs, so hopefully I'll add some to spice the site up. Here is one now: </p>

    <p>I'm beginning to dislike google sites, but I'm still apprehensive about starting over on pure html. Maybe if I got something like Microsoft FrontPage working I could use that. I got windows movie maker working just fine so maybe. I wish I could embed the frog in some text instead of having these gaps. I guess its so that the website looks okay on mobile as well. Not a huge fan of mobile to be honest. I think I'd prefer a world where the internet stayed at home on a desk in a specific room. Maybe that's why I'm so fascinated with the early internet. It was truly like a different world. Now the internet and the real world are so intertwined. You would think that would mean more people acting like they would in real life on the internet but sadly it seems to have the opposite effect. I like to look at old geocities pages sometimes and people actually seem much more normal. Well, I guess not, the novelty of it nowadays sort of excuses any oddities, I suppose. Like they aren't real people or something. There's just something comforting about it. I'm very glad that the internet archive exists. I hope their little run in with the copyright police doesn't shut them down. Heaven forbid we allow people to read books.</p>
