    <p>I've converted the site to pure html and css. Wow! It's truly an authentic website now! I will say that it looks much worse, but some might find it endearing. It's currently 12:21 am, so I'm just kind of squeezing this in here, but I'm happy to finally have finished converting the site. This is my first entry using html. How exciting. Just do me a favour and do not press f12. I'ts very disgusting in there and I don't want anyone being grossed out.</p>
