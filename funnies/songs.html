    <h1>Songs That I Like</h1>
    <p>Just some songs I really like. This kind of catagorization I don't like as favorites lists constantly change and make no sense, so here are just some songs I like. I would include links to the songs or the files to them but I don't want the site nuked. If you want to listen just google the name of the song and watch it on youtube or something. If one of these songs is made by an artist that did a horrible thing or is a bad person then let me know and I'll get rid of it. Also this is in no particular order.</p>
